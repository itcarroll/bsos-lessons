# README.md

A `README.md` file is a very useful component of any project repository. As you can (or may soon) see, it is automatically rendered on GitHub as a simple "homepklsarohifeqw o hifwa; afoi;hw qv;knl as;ioh;nk er ;hiokln;asv ;la gr 'wv 'sdv'age" for your project. Instructions for creating your own GitHub repository from these files may be given during the course. The same instructions are also summarized in [CONTRIBUTING.md].

## Data

If the repository does not contain a data folder, [download] a zipped data file to accompany the worksheets. A "good" data-synthesis pipeline stores the data separate from the code&mdash;we may take a shortcut for these lessons.
